				It is very important to stick to the syntax of a programing language. The syntax of a programing language includes things like how commands are distinguished from another or how variables are acessed and made.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the .code language there can only be one command per line. A new command has to be on a new line. It is also important that the things that go behind a command, called arguments, are each sepparated by one space. Furthermore variables have to go inside brackets otherwise they will be taken as the thing you typed. You also have to make sure that you spell keywords like commands correctly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the things you have learned fix the code below. The result should be 990.
